    <p>This website is a project for college</p>
    <p>Take what you read here with a grain of salt, what i say may be factually incorrect or specific to when the website was made</p>
    <p>I decided to make a metal music website for my university project because I am a passionate fan of the genre and I wanted to create a space where fellow metalheads can come together to discover new music, read about the latest news and trends in the scene, <br>  I wanted to create a platform where metal music fans could come together to discover new music <br>and learn more about the history and culture of metal music Ultimately, I hope that my website will inspire and engage metal music fans, and help to promote this dynamic and influential genre of music.</p>
